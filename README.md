# accourse2019
Repository for course materials for the antigenic cartography and antibody landscapes course 2019.

## Course plan

### Day 1, An introduction to antigenic cartography
_Wednesday 12th June_

We will go over antigenic cartography, the concepts behind it and it’s applications. We will introduce R and the RStudio development environment, going over how to install and get help using the antigenic cartography software. We will use the GUI (interactive application) to make and test antigenic maps.

<br/>

### Day 2, Programatically processing data and making maps
_Thursday 13th June_

We will spend more time introducing the R programming language and the core concepts behind it. We will learn how to write code to process data in different formats and how to programatically generate antigenic maps, run diagnostics and perform tasks such as analysing maps based on genetic properties.

<br/>

### Day 3, Making your own plots and more complex analyses
_Friday 14th June_

We will go over the built-in plotting system in R, exploring how you can make your own plots of data to your own specifications. We will introduce R’s powerful suite of statistical tools and more complex methods of analysis.

<br/>

### Day 4, An introduction to antibody landscapes and serological analysis
_Monday 17th June_

We will explore more general methods for serological analysis and the common difficulties and short-comings encountered when analysing serological data that often go under-appreciated.  We will introduce the antibody landscapes methodology and how this can help you to overcome some of these problems, alongside other approaches you can take to improve your analyses.

<br/>

### Day 5, Learning how to contribute as part of the programming community
_Tuesday 18th June_

On the final day we will talk about how you can take things further yourself and get you started making your own tools and packages in R.  We will introduce github, how to download and make your own changes to the source code of different packages and suggest your own updates to the software.
